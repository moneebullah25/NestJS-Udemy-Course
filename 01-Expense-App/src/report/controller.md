Let's break down the code step by step:
1. Importing required modules and classes:

```typescript
import {
  Controller,
  Get,
  Post,
  Put,
  Delete,
  Param,
  Body,
  HttpCode,
  ParseUUIDPipe,
  ParseEnumPipe,
} from '@nestjs/common';
```



In this section, the necessary modules and decorators from the `@nestjs/common` package are imported. These decorators are used to define routes and handle HTTP methods in the controller.
1. Importing related classes and interfaces:

```typescript
import { ReportType } from 'src/data';
import {
  CreateReportDto,
  ReportResponseDto,
  UpdateReportDto,
} from 'src/dtos/report.dto';
import { ReportService } from './report.service';
```



Here, the `ReportType` enum is imported from `'src/data'`, which is used to represent the type of reports (income or expense).

`CreateReportDto`, `ReportResponseDto`, and `UpdateReportDto` are imported from `'src/dtos/report.dto'`. These are Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) that define the structure of the data for creating, updating, and responding to reports.

`ReportService` is imported from `'./report.service'`. This service contains the business logic for handling reports. 
1. Defining the `ReportController` class:

```typescript
@Controller('report/:type')
export class ReportController {
  constructor(private readonly reportService: ReportService) {}
```



The `ReportController` class is defined as a controller using the `@Controller()` decorator. The string `'report/:type'` passed to the decorator sets the base route path for this controller. It means that all routes in this controller will start with `/report/` followed by a dynamic segment `:type`, which will be extracted from the URL.

The controller class constructor takes an instance of the `ReportService` and assigns it to a private property `reportService`. This is an example of dependency injection, where the service is automatically provided to the controller.
1. Handling HTTP GET requests for retrieving all reports:

```typescript
@Get()
getAllReports(
  @Param('type', new ParseEnumPipe(ReportType)) type: string,
): ReportResponseDto[] {
  const reportType = type === 'income' ? ReportType.INCOME : ReportType.EXPENSE;
  return this.reportService.getAllReports(reportType);
}
```



The `@Get()` decorator is used to handle HTTP GET requests for retrieving all reports. This method gets all reports based on the provided `type` (income or expense).

The `@Param('type', new ParseEnumPipe(ReportType))` decorator is used to extract the value of the `type` parameter from the URL. The `ParseEnumPipe` is a custom pipe that ensures the `type` parameter matches one of the values defined in the `ReportType` enum.

The method then calls the `reportService.getAllReports()` method, passing the determined `reportType` as an argument. It returns an array of `ReportResponseDto` objects representing the retrieved reports.
1. Handling HTTP GET requests for retrieving a specific report by ID:

```typescript
@Get(':id')
getReportById(
  @Param('type', new ParseEnumPipe(ReportType)) type: string,
  @Param('id', ParseUUIDPipe) id: string,
): ReportResponseDto {
  const reportType = type === 'income' ? ReportType.INCOME : ReportType.EXPENSE;
  return this.reportService.getReportById(reportType, id);
}
```



The `@Get(':id')` decorator is used to handle HTTP GET requests for retrieving a specific report by its ID.

The `@Param('id', ParseUUIDPipe)` decorator is used to extract the value of the `id` parameter from the URL and parse it as a UUID using the `ParseUUIDPipe`.

The method calls the `reportService.getReportById()` method, passing the `reportType` and `id` as arguments. It returns a single `ReportResponseDto` representing the retrieved report.
1. Handling HTTP POST requests for creating a new report:

```typescript
@Post()
createReport(
  @Body() { amount, source }: CreateReportDto,
  @Param('type', new ParseEnumPipe(ReportType)) type: string,
): ReportResponseDto {
  const reportType = type === 'income' ? ReportType.INCOME : ReportType.EXPENSE;
  return this.reportService.createReport(reportType, { amount, source });
}
```



The `@Post()` decorator is used to handle HTTP POST requests for creating a new report.

The `@Body()` decorator is used to extract the request body containing the `amount` and `source` properties from the request payload. It uses the `CreateReportDto` class to validate and parse the incoming data.

The `@Param('type', new ParseEnumPipe(ReportType))` decorator extracts the value of the `type` parameter from the URL and validates that it matches one of the values defined in the `ReportType` enum.

The method calls the `reportService.createReport()` method, passing the `reportType` and the data extracted from the request body. It returns a `ReportResponseDto` representing the newly created report.
1. Handling HTTP PUT requests for updating an existing report:

```typescript

@Put(':id')
updateReport(
  @Param('type', new ParseEnumPipe(ReportType)) type: string,
  @Param('id', ParseUUIDPipe) id: string,
  @Body() body: UpdateReportDto,
): ReportResponseDto {
  const reportType = type === 'income' ? ReportType.INCOME : ReportType.EXPENSE;
  return this.reportService.updateReport(reportType, id, body);
}
```



The `@Put(':id')` decorator is used to handle HTTP PUT requests for updating an existing report by its ID.

The `@Body()` decorator is used to extract the request body containing the properties to be updated, which are defined in the `UpdateReportDto` class.

The `@Param('type', new ParseEnumPipe(ReportType))` decorator extracts the `type` parameter from the URL and validates it against the `ReportType` enum, as seen in previous methods.

The `@Param('id', ParseUUIDPipe)` decorator extracts the `id` parameter from the URL and validates it as a UUID, similar to previous methods.

The method calls the `reportService.updateReport()` method, passing the `reportType`, `id`, and the data extracted from the request body. It returns a `ReportResponseDto` representing the updated report.
1. Handling HTTP DELETE requests for deleting a report:

```typescript

@HttpCode(204)
@Delete(':id')
deleteReport(@Param('id', ParseUUIDPipe) id: string) {
  return this.reportService.deleteReport(id);
}
```



The `@HttpCode(204)` decorator is used to set the HTTP status code of the response to 204 (No Content) for successful DELETE requests. It means that the operation was successful, and there is no response body.

The `@Delete(':id')` decorator is used to handle HTTP DELETE requests for deleting a report by its ID.

The `@Param('id', ParseUUIDPipe)` decorator extracts the `id` parameter from the URL and validates it as a UUID.

The method calls the `reportService.deleteReport()` method, passing the `id` of the report to be deleted. If the report is found and successfully deleted, the response will have a status code of 204.

In summary, the `ReportController` class defines various route handlers for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). It uses custom pipes and decorators to handle and validate incoming data from request parameters and payloads. The actual business logic for handling the reports is delegated to the `ReportService` class, which interacts with the example data defined in `data.ts` to perform CRUD operations. The responses are returned to the client in the form of `ReportResponseDto` objects, which define the structure of the response data.
