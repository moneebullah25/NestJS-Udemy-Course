Let's go through the code step by step:
1. Importing required modules and classes:

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import { ValidationPipe } from '@nestjs/common';
```



In this section, the required modules and classes are imported. `NestFactory` is used to create the Nest application, and `AppModule` is the root module of the application. The `ValidationPipe` class is imported from `@nestjs/common` and is used for request payload validation and data transformation.
1. Bootstrap function and Nest application creation:

```typescript
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  // ...
}
bootstrap();
```



The `bootstrap` function is an asynchronous function that serves as the entry point to the Nest application. It is an async function because some operations, like creating the Nest application, may involve asynchronous tasks.

The `NestFactory.create` method is used to create the Nest application instance. It takes the `AppModule` as an argument, which represents the root module of the application. The `AppModule` is responsible for orchestrating the various modules and components of the Nest application.
1. Global ValidationPipe configuration:

```typescript
app.useGlobalPipes(
  new ValidationPipe({
    whitelist: true,
    transform: true,
    transformOptions: {
      enableImplicitConversion: true,
    },
  }),
);
```



In this section, a global instance of the `ValidationPipe` is created and configured. The `ValidationPipe` is a middleware in Nest.js that automatically validates incoming request payloads and performs data transformation according to the defined rules. 
- `whitelist: true`: This option is set to `true`, which means that during validation, any properties that do not have a corresponding validation decorator (e.g., `@IsString`, `@IsNumber`, etc.) will be stripped from the request payload. Only properties explicitly decorated with validation decorators will be allowed in the incoming payload. 
- `transform: true`: This option is set to `true`, which enables automatic data transformation. It means that when data is received in the request payload, the `ValidationPipe` will automatically attempt to convert it to the corresponding data types based on the validation rules and the types defined in the DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) or entity classes. 
- `transformOptions: { enableImplicitConversion: true }`: This option enables implicit conversion of incoming data during the transformation process. When implicit conversion is enabled, Nest will try to convert incoming data to the expected data type if possible. For example, if an API expects a `number`, but the client sends a string representing a number, Nest will attempt to convert the string to a number automatically.
1. Listening to incoming requests:

```typescript
await app.listen(3333);
```



This line of code starts the Nest application, and it listens for incoming HTTP requests on port 3333. The `app.listen` method is an asynchronous operation, so we use the `await` keyword to wait for the application to start and bind to the specified port.

In summary, the code sets up a Nest.js application using the `NestFactory.create` method, configures a global `ValidationPipe` with specific options to handle validation and data transformation for incoming requests, and then starts the application to listen for incoming HTTP requests on port 3333. The `ValidationPipe` helps in ensuring that the data received by the application is valid and appropriately transformed before it is processed by the business logic or forwarded to the appropriate controllers.
